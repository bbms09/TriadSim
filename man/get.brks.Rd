\title{Picking chromosomal breaking points}
\usage{
get.brks(N.brk, n.ped, snp.all2, target.snp, rcmb.rate = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{N.brk}{is an integer giving the number of breaks to be picked for each chromosome.}

\item{n.ped}{is an integer giving the number of trios to be simulated}

\item{snp.all2}{is a dataframe containing the list of SNPs in PLINK .bim format. Two columns of the dataframe
is used: column 1 with column name "V1" containing the chromosome number and column 4 with column name "V4"
containing the chromosomal postion of the SNPs.}

\item{target.snp}{is a vector of integers showing the row number of the target SNPs in the .bim file.}

\item{rcmb.rate}{the default value is NA. rcmb.rate is a dataframe containing the recombination rates at each SNP. The ordering of the SNPs should 
be identical to that of snp.all2. It contains 4 columns with column names "V1", "V2","V3",and "V4" with the 
corresponding values for "the chromosomal number", "SNP rs number", "chromosomal position",
and "recombination rate". The recombination rate represents the maximum recombination rate in the chromosomal
region between the current SNP and the SNP above (or the first basepair of the chromosome for the first SNP on a chromosome).
When no rcmb.rate is provided the function will pick the breaking points randomly where keeping the breaking
points in between target SNPs.}
}
\value{
A list of two elements is returned. The first one is a matrix of integers showing where 
the chromosomal breaks is to take place for each individual in the simulated trios. The second one
is a matrix showing the chromosomal segments out of which is each target SNP selected for each simulated trio.
}
\description{
The breaking points at each chromosome can be picked manually or use this function. 
When a dataframe containing the recombination rate (rcmb.rate) is provided the function
tends to pick the breaking points at recombination hotspots.
